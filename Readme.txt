Author: Don Waldron - Version 1.2.1

Developed using Anaconda 2 on Windows 8.1, 
                Spyder 2.3.7, with Python 2.7.10 and PyQt4 

bmi.py                 - The main (the file to execute)
convert_ui_to_py.bat   - Creates Ui_MainWin.py from Ui_MainWin.ui 

bmi\.spyderproject     - The Anaconda Spyder project (which needs bmi.py added,
                         but I didn't know how to add)
bmi\BmiApp.py          - Instantiates a class of Ui_MainWindow, binds callback 
                         to a pushbutton and displays (shows) the GUI
bmi\BmiUiCallbacks.py  - One callback, which calculates and displays BMI
 
designer\Ui_MainWin.ui - GUI developed with QT 4.8.7 /  QT Designer 4.8.7
designer\Ui_MainWin.py - Autogenerated Python code for class Ui_MainWindow
                         Created from Ui_MainWin.ui using convert_ui_to_py.bat
                         which uses 'pyuic4' to converts QT Designer-generated 
                         designer\Ui_MainWin.ui to this Python file
